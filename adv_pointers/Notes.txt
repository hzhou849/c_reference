C we are dealing with bytes

Calloc 
-clears memory on initialization with nulls 
- 2 arguments 
	i) number of elements in the array
	ii) size of each element 

malloc - you may still have wildcard data from before

both malloc and calloc return a generic pointer, a pointer to void or
a null pointer if the alloocation of memory fails


null pointer - a pointer with zero value

2-21
free 
	- be careful if you use this free on memory that was never allocated or on memory that was
  	  not intended to be allocated.

2-22
realloc
	- change the size of block of allocated memory referenced by an existing 
	  pointer


2-25 
pointers to structs
	- predefining data sizes for malloc can be dangerous bc the size can always vary based
	  on compiler/OS.

2-26
Data Type Alignment 
	- Allocating memory inside a struct will occupy contiguous memory locations.
	- based on how the data is aligned in Structs the size will be different bc of how they are being aligned in memory.
	- Because A is declared (w/ calloc, they are initialized with NULLS '/0') and only use 4 bytes, 
	  the next 4 bytes is not enough for a double, so it is padded
	  'x'and the iniitalization of B happens after those 4 bytes.

case 1:
typedef struct {
	int a;				//4bytes
	int c; 				// 4 bytes
	double b;			//8bytes
	long long int d;	// 8bytes
}MYSTRUCT;

sizeof=24

case 2:
typedef struct {								
	int a;				//4bytes								
	double b;			//8bytes								
	int c; 				// 4 bytes								
	long long int d;	// 8bytes								
}MYSTRUCT;								
size of = 32								

case 1:
AAAA CCCC
BBBB BBBB
DDDD DDDD = 3x8 = 24 bytes used.

case2:
A A A A	  \0\0\0\0 (NULLS)
B B B B    B B B B
C C C C   \0\0\0\0
D D D D    D D D D = 4 x 8 = 32bytes used


review structs, do pointer exercises

char *str = "hello world"
-str is a pointer to char whose value is the address fo the char array "hello world"
