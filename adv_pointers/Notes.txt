Calloc 
-clears memory on initialization with nulls 
- 2 arguments 
	i) number of elements in the array
	ii) size of each element 

malloc - you may still have wildcard data from before

both malloc and calloc return a generic pointer, a pointer to void or
a null pointer if the alloocation of memory fails


null pointer - a pointer with zero value

free 
	- be careful if you use this free on memory that was never allocated or on memory that was
  	  not intended to be allocated.

2-22
realloc
	- change the size of block of allocated memory referenced by an existing 
	  pointer
