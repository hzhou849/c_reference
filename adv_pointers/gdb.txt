gdb

1)gcc -g <filename.c> 
- this will generate a.out


2)then run gdb a.out

3) set the breakpoints by 'break <#line number> || or <function_name>'

4) run <args (if any)>

print <var_name> if needed


NOTES:
c or continue: Debugger will continue executing until the next break point.
n or next: Debugger will execute the next line as single instruction.
s or step: Same as next, but does not treats function as a single instruction, instead goes into the function and executes it line by line.
